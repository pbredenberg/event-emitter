## What is it?

A small library that provides an event emitter mixin that can be added to your own JS
classes / objects to allow them to implement a pubsub/listener/observer pattern by means
of events.

There are a number of other libraries out there to do this, but many of them are either
not well-tested or have some other deficiency. We needed a solid, quality event emitter
mixin that we could use in a variety of projects.

This event emitter will work both in node.js and in the browser.

TODO: add comments about how to include it in your codebase (node - require, browser -
browserify, other?). Also, add comments about needing a promise library / polyfill if you
are going to use it in the browser.

## How do I use it?

Here's an example of how you can use this library:

```js
// TODO
```
